      <h1>What is the difference between localStorage and sessionStorage?</h1>
      <p>
        Local Storage: This read-only interface property provides access to the
        Document’s local storage object, the stored data is stored across
        browser sessions. Similar to sessionStorage, except that localStorage
        data gets cleared when the page session ends – that is when the page is
        closed. It is cleared when the last “private” tab of a browser is closed
        (localStorage data for a document loaded in a private browsing or
        incognito session).
        <br />

        Local Storage: It’s session-based and works per window or tab. This
        means that data is stored only for the duration of a session, until the
        browser (or tab) is closed
      </p>
      <br />
      <h1>What is the difference global scope and local scope?</h1>
      <p>
        A global variable has global scope. A global variable is accessible from
        anywhere in the code. Local Scope - Local scope contains things defined
        inside code blocks. A local variable has local scope.
      </p>

        JavaScript has a runtime model based on an event loop, which is
        responsible for executing the code, collecting and processing events,
        and executing queued sub-tasks.
